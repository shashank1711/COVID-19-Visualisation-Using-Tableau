# Description

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
So, it becomes the most important data right now. In this project I've created a dashboard which 
works as a global coronavirus tracker to help you stay updated on the confirmed cases and the death cases,
the spread of coronavirus across the world, and the top 10 countries affected by this pandemic.
